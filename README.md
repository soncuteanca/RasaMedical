## üîß Installation

### 1. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/soncuteanca/RasaMedical

# Navigate to project directory
cd RasaMedical

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model

```bash
# Train the model
rasa train
```

### 3. Running the Application

You need to run three servers simultaneously:

1. **Flask Server** (for user management API):
```bash
python server.py
```
This runs on port 5000 and handles user creation and management.

2. **Rasa Action Server** (for custom actions):
```bash
rasa run actions
```
This runs the custom actions like fetching users.

3. **Rasa Server** (for chat functionality):
```bash
rasa run -m models --enable-api --cors "*" --debug
```
This runs the Rasa model and enables the chat API.

### 4. Access the Application

1. Open the project in PyCharm
2. Open `html/home_page.html` in PyCharm (it will open on port 63342)
3. You can now:
   - Use the chat functionality
   - Create new users
   - Access all features of the application

The application uses multiple ports:
- Port 63342: PyCharm's server for serving HTML pages
- Port 5000: Flask server for user management API
- Port 5005: Rasa server for chat functionality
